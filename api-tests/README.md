### API testing

In this folder you will find the following items:

1. a JSON file containing the Postman collection of API tests I created for the loan calculator. To open the file:
     - open Postman
     - click “Import”
     - select “Upload Files”
     - choose the .json file
     - click “Import”.

3. a PDF file containing:
    - a brief overview of my testing strategy
    - a report of the test results
    - an elaboration of the tests that failed.
